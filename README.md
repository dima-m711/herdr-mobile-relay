# Herdr Mobile Relay

[![check](https://github.com/dima-m711/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dima-m711/herdr-mobile-relay/actions/workflows/check.yml)

> **Fork development branch:** Linux defaults to private Tailscale setup; existing explicit alternatives and macOS remain supported. See [private Linux setup, adoption and updates](docs/tailscale-linux.md). No fork release is published by this work; do not substitute an upstream bundle for a private-capable fork release.
>
> Fork of [0cv/herdr-mobile-relay](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay), retaining upstream attribution and AGPL-3.0-or-later licensing.

Control [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) agents from your phone. Each Linux or macOS
computer runs its own relay; the phone connects to them and merges every agent
into one installable web app.

**Upstream base version:** [`0.22.6`](https://github.com/0cv/herdr-mobile-relay/releases/tag/v0.22.6) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Native Windows is not supported. WSL2 may work but is not tested.

> [!WARNING]
> 0.20.0 replaces the shared relay key with per-device credentials and a new
> encrypted transport. It cannot be installed through the phone updater:
> [upgrade the relay manually and pair every phone again](docs/updates.md#upgrading-from-v0191).

## Legacy transport alternatives

For this fork's private Linux default, use the [Tailscale guide](docs/tailscale-linux.md). The instructions below describe explicitly selected legacy transports, not an automatic public fallback.

Requirements: Herdr 0.7.5 or newer, Git, and `curl`. Herdr 0.9.0 is
recommended for the complete live JSON inventory and workspace-management
surface; the relay does not treat that recommendation as a new minimum.

The relay reports the installed Herdr client version separately from the
running local server version and protocol. A server upgrade can enable or
disable individual actions without changing the relay release.

```bash
herdr plugin install dima-m711/herdr-mobile-relay
```

The setup menu opens automatically after installation.

To reopen the main setup menu later:

```bash
herdr plugin pane open \
  --plugin herdr-mobile-relay.events \
  --entrypoint setup \
  --placement zoomed \
  --focus
```

Start with **Community WebRTC Gateway**. It is the recommended path: as fast
to set up as the temporary tunnel, with stable relay connectivity and no
Cloudflare account, domain, `cloudflared`, or tunnel configuration. If prompted,
choose the installed Herdr app that should host the phone UI. The relay starts
and prints a QR code.

**Temporary Cloudflare Tunnel** is the fastest getting-started option for a
one-computer trial. It installs any missing user-level tools with confirmation,
starts the relay and bundled app, and prints a QR code.

Scan the QR with your phone. Keep the pane open; Ctrl-C stops the relay.

Neither quick-start path needs `sudo` or a Python, Node.js, or Go toolchain.
Treat the QR and its setup link as secrets: they contain a one-use device
invitation.

[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) has pairing detail and troubleshooting for both
paths.

- Monitor and control agents across several computers, grouped by status and
  Herdr workspace, with agents that need input pinned on top.
- Answer approvals and structured plan questions from Codex, Claude Code,
  Hermes, Qoder, OpenCode, Oh My Pi, and Pi.
- Send prompts, terminal keys, and slash commands, including discovered Cursor
  commands and skills; attach screenshots, photos, and documents in cancellable
  batches. Optionally discover live Pi extension commands, skills, and templates
  after [installing the Pi integration](docs/slash-command-discovery.md#pi-runtime-commands).
- Read and search each agent's native conversation, including Hermes, OpenCode
  and Oh My OpenCode plans; inspect workspace files, images, and Git diffs
  read-only.
- Manage workspaces and Git worktrees; start, rename, clear, and stop agents.
- Have the relay read responses aloud, even with the screen off.
- Pair every phone as its own named device — controller or read-only reader —
  each with its own notification rules, and revoke any of them.

**New in 0.22.0:** Cursor slash-command and skill suggestions, optional live Pi
command discovery, verified text entry in Cursor model pickers, and safer agent
launches and background-service upgrades.

## Mobile onboarding

The walkthrough follows setup from scanning the QR through the agent list,
terminal controls, and notification settings.

## Choosing how your phone connects

The setup menu exposes each complete connection path directly:

| Choice | Needs | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Community gateway | no account, domain, or tunnel configuration; an installed app origin | the recommended stable, no-configuration relay path |
| Cloudflare tunnel | nothing for a temporary URL; a Cloudflare account and domain for a permanent hostname | the fastest one-computer trial or a permanent background service |
| Your own gateway | a small VPS | dedicated bandwidth and control of the transport logs |

All three are end-to-end encrypted. On either gateway the phone and the computer
then negotiate a direct peer-to-peer connection, leaving the gateway with the
fallback; Cloudflare tunnel traffic stays on Cloudflare.

## Agents with a non-default config directory

The relay runs as a background service and does not see a pane's
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, or similar. If an agent's
conversation shows as unavailable or a profile's slash commands are missing,
point the relay at that profile with `HERDR_*_CONFIG_DIRS`:

## Security in one paragraph

Prompts, terminal output, uploads, and push details are encrypted end to end
between the phone and the relay. Whatever carries the traffic — a Cloudflare
tunnel or a gateway — observes connection metadata only, never plaintext; on the
direct path no application data reaches it at all, though a gateway still
answers address discovery. Paired credentials distinguish controller and
reader devices, mutations default to controller-only, attachment references
stay bound to the terminal and agent session that created them, and the app can
require device verification before it reconnects.
